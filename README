# GAP: Generic Agent Pattern
The generic agent pattern is a common pattern that can be reused with multiple interfaces 
while the functionality; like driving and monitoring of the interface, can be implemented using callbacks.

This approach ensures a clean inheritance hierarchy in the testbench components. 
It also provides faster testbenche development time for configurable designs that can support multiple interface protocols.
